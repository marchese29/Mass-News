#[MassNe.ws](http://massne.ws)
Putting the news in the hands of the masses.  Built at MHacks IV (9/5/14 - 9/7/14)

###Purpose
In the fast paced world that we live in today, it is not always sufficient to wait for the mainstream media to report on the immediate news.  Even when the mainstream media reports on events, there is almost always some sort of spin on the news, leaving consumers to sort out the facts versus the bias.  MassNe.ws is an attempt to change all of that.

MassNe.ws allows anyone to contribute and report the news with their smartphones.  If you are in the middle of a newsworthy event, all you need to do is take out your phone, open the MassNe.ws app, and start streaming your perspective.  On the web, the MassNe.ws site allows all visitors to see your streamed news perspective, allowing them to get their news straight from the source.

###Functionality
The way MassNe.ws currently is functioning, there is a mobile (iOS component) and a web component.  On the iOS application, users can stream newsworthy events from their phones to our backend server, which allows it to be viewed on our frontend website.
